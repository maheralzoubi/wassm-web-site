# Quick Redeploy Guide

## Steps to Redeploy

### 1. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel (Automatic)
If you've connected your GitHub repo to Vercel:
- **Automatic**: Just push to your main branch, Vercel will auto-deploy
- **Manual**: Run `vercel --prod` from command line

### 3. Deploy to Netlify (Automatic)
If you've connected your GitHub repo to Netlify:
- **Automatic**: Just push to your main branch, Netlify will auto-deploy
- **Manual**: Run `netlify deploy --prod` from command line

### 4. Manual Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The dist folder contains your production files
# Upload the contents of dist/ to your hosting service
```

## What Gets Deployed

- ✅ All files in `client/` folder
- ✅ Configuration files: `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`
- ✅ Build output: `dist/` folder (generated by `npm run build`)

## Important Notes

- The `dist/` folder is in `.gitignore` (it's generated, don't commit it)
- Make sure `package.json` has the correct dependencies
- Vite version is set to `^6.0.0` for compatibility

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build
npm run preview

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod
```
